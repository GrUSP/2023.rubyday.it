        talk_title: "How ChatGPT Works"
        talk_description: "
ChatGPT astonishes everyone, including maybe his own designers. As software developers, we're always looking for the gears behind the magic. <br/> How can this thing possibly work?<br />

Unfortunately, delving into AI is no piece of cake. Even for programmers, modern AI is an intimidating field, ridden with math jargon and research-y conventions. <br />Transformers, word vectors, deep recurrent neural networks… <br />This talk doesn't simplify or dumb down those complex topics. Instead, it explains them in the language of developers: diagrams, examples, and code.

Give me some time, and I'll give you an intuitive, high-level understanding of AI language models. Let's demystify language AI!"

        talk_title: "Anatomy of a Sonic Pi Song"
        talk_description: "Have you ever considered what makes a \"good\" song? <br />
        Maybe it's a sweet melody, or the beat that keeps you pushing through to the end of a workout. Whatever the use case, Sonic Pi can synthesize it. <br />
        In our session together, raia takes participants through coding a range of song components, and together, we'll build a band of live loops including: rhythm sections, melody, chord progressions and audio embellishments. <br />
        We'll build a song that can be mixed and modified at will and in the process, learn some key elements of what makes Sonic Pi \"sing.\" 
        <br /> Expect to walk away with a deeper understanding of samples, synthesizers, live loops, if/for statements, spreads, rings, and lists, all within the Ruby-reliant context of Sonic Pi's live coding environment."

        talk_title: "One-on-One: the benefit you should look for"
        talk_description: "One-on-one meetings are crucial for promoting a healthy company culture, but do the participants truly recognize their value? <br />
The theory says these meetings provide an excellent opportunity for managers and employees to improve communication, reduce conflicts, and increase job satisfaction and motivation.
The reality shows that one-on-one effectiveness relies heavily on human interactions, making success unpredictable. <br/>
<br />During the session, we'll explore effective practices to help answer questions such as:
<br />What makes one-on-one meetings effective for managers and what for engineers?
<br />How can we effectively communicate with silent individuals during these meetings?
<br />Should we establish an agenda for the meeting or not?
<br />Should personal matters be discussed during those sections?
<br /><br />This talk is a must-attend if you want to improve your team management skills or gain insight into how one-on-one meetings can contribute to your professional development."

        Or maybe you trod nervously during a refactor? Or perhaps you broke an app by changing the backend data in a way you didn’t think would matter? <br /><br /> 
        This talk will show you how avoid these mistakes, enabling you to keep moving fast, by having a single source of truth for your data types, checked both on the frontend and the backend."

        talk_title: "The Functional Alternative"
        talk_description: "We'll start with a simple Ruby Kata and solve it together, live, with imperative programming. 
        <br />We'll then fix the many, many, many things we got wrong. Then we'll solve the problem again using patterns from functional programming. You'll leave this talk with a clear and concrete example of why functional programming matters, why immutable code matters, and why it can help you writing bug-free code. 
        
        <br /> <br />The next time you find yourself writing imperative code, you'll think about... the functional alternative."
