        talk_title: "How ChatGPT Works"
        talk_description: "
ChatGPT astonishes everyone, including maybe his own designers. As software developers, we're always looking for the gears behind the magic. <br/> How can this thing possibly work?<br />

Unfortunately, delving into AI is no piece of cake. Even for programmers, modern AI is an intimidating field, ridden with math jargon and research-y conventions. <br />Transformers, word vectors, deep recurrent neural networksâ€¦ <br />This talk doesn't simplify or dumb down those complex topics. Instead, it explains them in the language of developers: diagrams, examples, and code.

Give me some time, and I'll give you an intuitive, high-level understanding of AI language models. Let's demystify language AI!"
